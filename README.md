# Klawerjass-Pub

In September 2023, I set off to build a web version of Klawerjass, a South African card game. 

I never finished this project, because its scope quickly outpaced what I was able to commit to while focusing on school and I dropped it in late 2024, but I learned an incredible amount while working on it. 

The project is in a state of disarray, but through building it I learned:
- **Frontend**:
  - HTML/Javascript/CSS
  - React
    
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - Next.js
  - Pug (React before I learned React)
  - Sqlite3 (Didn't end up going with this as it was difficult to deal with multiple requests and debugging was a nightmare because this wasn't obviously stated)
  - PostgreSQL
  - Ngrok (Only for integrating AWS and later Raspberry Pi server with my laptop as a DB, never meant for long term use)
  - AWS
    
- **General**:
  - Project planning/management
  - Time management
  - Problem solving
